## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends then using visualizations in order to display the data in a more ogranized and coherent fashion. Primary focus was serving our client in that she was in the process of starting up a crowdfunding project (theatre/plays) with a budget of $4000. After sorting through a large amount of kickstarter data, I was able to seperate what was valuable to her and what wasn't based on the Parent Category of theatre and Subcategory of plays from all over the country. Using data tables, pivot tables, pivot charts and different variations of visualizations it was much easier for her to gain a clear undertsanding of the reality of success that she may be able to achieve in her crowdfunding project.
